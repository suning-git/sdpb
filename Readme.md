# SDPD

SDPD computes `dx,dy,dX,dY` and derivative of the primal objective with respect to the change of bootstrap condition.

## Usage

The usage of sdpd is

    sdpd --procsPerNode=[N] --[MODE] -s [SDP1] -d [SDP2] -i [INCK] -o [OUTCK] --precision=[PRECISION]

`[N]` is the number of cpu cores. `[MODE]` specify the mode of sdpd (see below). `[SDP1]` and `[SDP2]` are two sdp folders. `[INCK]` is a checkpoint folder contains `x,y,X,Y` in text format (from sdpb `--writeSolution="x,y,X,Y"` option). `[OUTCK]` is a folder for saving `dx,dy,dX,dY`. The `-o [OUTCK]` is optional. If not specified, `dx,dy,dX,dY` will not be saved. `[PRECISION]` should be the same precision that you used in sdpb to get `[INCK]`.

Before above command, certain MPI command should be specified. The full command might look like `mpirun -n [N] sdpd ...` . The `mpirun -n [N]` part could be slightly different in different clusters. It should be the command you use for sdpb 2.4.0.

SDPD can work in 3 different modes. In all modes, the derivative of the primal objective is returned by printing out `[SDPDReturnBegin]...[SDPDReturnEnd]`.

### Mode 1: `--SDP1_db` : Only `b` changes.

In this mode, `[SDP1]` is a sdp folder contains same bootstrap condition that used to generate `[INCK]`, except the objective `b` is replace by a derivative `db`. `-d` should not be specified. SDPD will compute the `dx,dy,dX,dY` with respect to change of `db`.

Example :

    mpirun -n 80 sdpd --procsPerNode=80 --SDP1_db -s ./sdp1db.sdp -i ./sdp1theta.out --precision 768


### Mode 2: `--SDP2_B_b_c` : All `B,b,c` changes. SDPD subtracts two SDPs to get `dB,db,dc`.

In this mode, `[SDP1]` is a sdp folder contains same bootstrap condition that used to generate `[INCK]`. `[SDP2]` is a sdp folder contains slightly deformed bootstrap condition. SDPD will subtract `[SDP1]-[SDP2]` to obtain `dB,db,dc` and compute the `dx,dy,dX,dY` with respect to those changes.

Example :

    mpirun -n 80 sdpd --procsPerNode=80 --SDP2_B_b_c -s ./sdp1theta.sdp -d ./sdp2theta.sdp -i ./sdp1theta.out --precision 768


### Mode 3: `--SDP2_dB_db_dc` : All `B,b,c` changes. The exact `dB,db,dc` is given to SDPD.

In this mode, `[SDP1]` is a sdp folder contains same bootstrap condition that used to generate `[INCK]`. `[SDP2]` is a sdp folder contains the change of bootstrap condition `dB,db,dc`. SDPD computes the `dx,dy,dX,dY` with respect to those changes.

Example :

    mpirun -n 80 sdpd --procsPerNode=80 --SDP2_dB_db_dc -s ./sdp1theta.sdp -d ./dsdptheta.sdp -i ./sdp1theta.out --precision 768
